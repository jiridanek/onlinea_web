  <p>Anthony DeFilippo was a forty-eight-year-old limousine driver
    from Everett, Massachusetts, who started to hemorrhage at a
    community hospital during surgery for a hernia and gallstones. The
    bleeding was finally stopped but his liver was severely damaged, and
    over the next few days he became too sick for the hospital’s
    facilities. When he arrived in our I.C.U., at 1:30 a.m. on a Sunday,
    his ragged black hair was plastered to his sweaty forehead, his body
    was shaking, and his heart was racing at a hundred and fourteen
    beats a minute. He was delirious from fever, shock, and low oxygen
    levels.</p>
  <p>“I need to get out!” he cried. “I need to get out!” He clawed
    at his gown, his oxygen mask, the dressings covering his abdominal
    wound.</p>
  <p>“Tony, it’s all right,” a nurse said to him. “We’re going to
    help you. You’re in a hospital.”</p>
  <p>He shoved her—he was a big man—and tried to swing his legs out
    of the bed. We turned up his oxygen flow, put his wrists in cloth
    restraints, and tried to reason with him. He eventually let us draw
    blood from him and give him antibiotics.</p>
  <p>The laboratory results came back showing liver failure, and a
    wildly elevated white-blood-cell count indicating infection. It soon
    became evident from his empty urine bag that his kidneys had failed,
    too. In the next few hours, his blood pressure fell, his breathing
    worsened, and he drifted from agitation to near-unconsciousness.
    Each of his organ systems, including his brain, was shutting down.</p>
  <p>I called his sister, who was his next of kin, and told her of
    the situation. “Do everything you can,” she said.</p>
  <p>So we did. We gave him a syringeful of anesthetic, and a
    resident slid a breathing tube into his throat. Another resident
    “lined him up.” She inserted a thin, two-inch-long needle and
    catheter through his upturned right wrist and into his radial
    artery, and then sewed the line to his skin with a silk suture.
    Next, she put in a central line—a twelve-inch catheter pushed into
    the jugular vein in his left neck. After she sewed that in place,
    and an X-ray showed its tip floating just where it was supposed
    to—inside his vena cava at the entrance to his heart—she put a
    third, slightly thicker line, for dialysis, through his right upper
    chest and into the subclavian vein, deep under the collarbone.</p>
  <p>We hooked a breathing tube up to a hose from a ventilator and
    set it to give him fourteen forced breaths of a hundred-per-cent
    oxygen every minute. We dialled the ventilator pressures and gas
    flow up and down, like engineers at a control panel, until we got
    the blood levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide where we wanted them.
    The arterial line gave us continuous arterial blood-pressure
    measurements, and we tweaked his medications to get the pressures we
    liked. We regulated his intravenous fluids according to
    venous-pressure measurements from his jugular line. We plugged his
    subclavian line into tubing from a dialysis machine, and every few
    minutes his entire blood volume washed through this artificial
    kidney and back into his body; a little adjustment here and there,
    and we could alter the levels of potassium and bicarbonate and salt
    in his body as well. He was, we liked to imagine, a simple machine
    in our hands.</p>
  <p>But he wasn’t, of course. It was as if we had gained a steering
    wheel and a few gauges and controls, but on a runaway
    eighteen-wheeler hurtling down a mountain. Keeping his blood
    pressure normal was requiring gallons of intravenous fluid and a
    pharmacy shelf of drugs. He was on near-maximal ventilator support.
    His temperature climbed to a hundred and four degrees. Less than
    five per cent of patients with his degree of organ failure make it
    home. And a single misstep could easily erase those slender chances.</p>


  <p>For ten days, though, all went well. His chief problem had been
    liver damage from the operation he’d had. The main duct from his
    liver was severed and was leaking bile, which is caustic—it digests
    the fat in one’s diet and was essentially eating him alive from the
    inside. He had become too sick to survive an operation to repair the
    leak. So we tried a temporary solution—we had radiologists place a
    plastic drain, using X-ray guidance, through his abdominal wall and
    into the severed duct in order to draw the leaking bile out of him.
    They found so much that they had to place three drains—one inside
    the duct and two around it. But, as the bile drained out, his fevers
    subsided. His requirements for oxygen and fluids diminished. His
    blood pressure returned to normal. He was on the mend. Then, on the
    eleventh day, just as we were getting ready to take him off the
    mechanical ventilator, he developed high, spiking fevers, his blood
    pressure sank, and his blood-oxygen levels plummeted again. His skin
    became clammy. He got shaking chills.</p>
  <p>We didn’t understand what had happened. He seemed to have
    developed an infection, but our X-rays and CT scans failed to turn
    up a source. Even after we put him on four antibiotics, he continued
    to spike fevers. During one fever, his heart went into fibrillation.
    A Code Blue was called. A dozen nurses and doctors raced to his
    bedside, slapped electric paddles onto his chest, and shocked him.
    His heart responded, fortunately, and went back into rhythm. It took
    two more days for us to figure out what had gone wrong. We
    considered the possibility that one of his lines had become
    infected, so we put in new lines and sent the old ones to the lab
    for culturing. Forty-eight hours later, the results returned: all of
    them were infected. The infection had probably started in one line,
    perhaps contaminated during insertion, and spread through his
    bloodstream to the others. Then they all began spilling bacteria
    into him, producing his fevers and steep decline.</p>
  <p>This is the reality of intensive care: at any point, we are as
    apt to harm as we are to heal. Line infections are so common that
    they are considered a routine complication. I.C.U.s put five million
    lines into patients each year, and national statistics show that,
    after ten days, four per cent of those lines become infected. Line
    infections occur in eighty thousand people a year in the United
    States, and are fatal between five and twenty-eight per cent of the
    time, depending on how sick one is at the start. Those who survive
    line infections spend on average a week longer in intensive care.
    And this is just one of many risks. After ten days with a urinary
    catheter, four per cent of American I.C.U. patients develop a
    bladder infection. After ten days on a ventilator, six per cent
    develop bacterial pneumonia, resulting in death forty to fifty-five
    per cent of the time. All in all, about half of I.C.U. patients end
    up experiencing a serious complication, and, once a complication
    occurs, the chances of survival drop sharply.</p>
  <p>It was a week before DeFilippo recovered sufficiently from his
    infections to come off the ventilator, and it was two months before
    he left the hospital. Weak and debilitated, he lost his limousine
    business and his home, and he had to move in with his sister. The
    tube draining bile still dangled from his abdomen; when he was
    stronger, I was going to have to do surgery to reconstruct the main
    bile duct from his liver. But he survived. Most people in his
    situation do not.</p>
