++<h3>Fill in the blanks</h3>
<p>The first task of the questionare is very frantic.
The audio is fast-paced and there is a lot of blanks to fill.
Thankfully, the listening is rather short, so you won't spent
much of your precious time even if you had to listen to it
multiple times.</p>
<p>In every box there should be exactly one word.
If you are unsure how to spell some of the words, you may find it in the vocabulary task below.</p>
<h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>You can use the following shortcuts for
a quick navigation <span class="unavailable dart">both with the HTML5 audio player and</span> in the questionnaire.</p>

<h5>Receptors for Taste Found in the Lungs</h5>
<p><i>Researchers were surprised to find receptors for bitter taste in the lungs,
and more surprised that activating them caused airways to greatly relax.

Take a deep breath. Taste anything? Actually, your  :t1_____  may. Because scientists have  :t2________  that the same  :t3______  that exist on the tongue to  :t4_____  bitter substances are also  :t5_____  on the smooth  :t6_____  of the  :t7_____ .

Researchers were studying the receptors on  :t8_____  lung muscles that regulate  :t9________  and relaxation of the  :t10_____ . That’s when they made the discovery—which was so  :t11_____  that the researchers themselves were  :t12_____ .

Finally, they  :t13_____  :t14_____  that the receptors were really there, though not  :t15_____  in taste buds as they are on the  :t16_____ . The scientists then exposed  :t17_____  and  :t18_____  airways to various bitter  :t19________  to  :t20_____  the effects.

Many  :t21_____  compounds are  :t22_____ , so the researchers expected the lung  :t23_____  to tense up and  :t24_____  -to compel the  :t25_____  to move away from whatever was bitter and  :t26_____  toxic. But, in a second surprise, bitter compounds  :t27_____  and  :t28_____  airways better than any existing asthma  :t29_____ . The study is in the  :t30_____  Nature Medicine *.

Researchers will  :t31_____  to  :t32_____  for the role of the receptors.  :t33________ , the work represents a surprising new  :t34_____  in the search for drugs to treat  :t35_____ ,  :t36________  or  :t37_____  :t38________ .

A medicine
 :m3


A newspaper or magazine that writes about particular topic or professional activity
 :m4


In the intervening period of time between two events.
 :m5


To initiate something or give a clue
 :m6


A long-term respiratory condition, in which the airways may unexpectedly and suddenly narrow, often in response to an allergen, cold air, exercise, or emotional stress. Symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. <i>[from wiktionary.org]</i>
 :m7


A chronic lung disease, characterised by an abnormal increase in the size of the air spaces, resulting in laboured breathing and caused by exposure to toxic chemicals such as tobacco smoke. <i>[wiktionary.org]</i>
 :m8


A medical condition described as inflammation of the bronchi of the lungs, that causes the cilia of the bronchial epithelial cells to stop functioning. </i>[wiktionary.org]</i>
 :m9


All parts of the respiratory system  through which air flows, conceptually beginning (on inhalation from the external environment) at the nose and mouth, and terminating in the alveoli. It is generally used synonymously with respiratory tract, to avoid sounding overly scientific. <i>[from en.wikipedia.org]</i>
