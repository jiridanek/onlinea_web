  <p>This questionare is primarily a listening exercise. It consists
    of a fill-in-the-blanks exercise and a supplementary translation
    exercise. The listening exercise requires you to fill-in some words
    that were left out from the transcript. In the translation exercise
    you are asked to pick and arrange English words to form translations
    of the Czech sentences you are given.</p>
  <p>The listening is an 18 minutes long interview with a
    programming language designer. You have been warned.</p>

  ++

  <h2>Fill in the blanks</h2>
  <p>The first task of the questionare is somewhat difficult. The
    audio is not of the best quality and there is a lot of background
    noise at times. There is also a lot of blanks to fill. Thankfully,
    the HTML5 audioplayer has some advanced ;) features regarding quick
    pausing and repeating last few seconds of the audio. With its help
    you should be able to fill everything in the first pass and you
    won't have to listen to the audio multiple times.</p>
  <p>In every box there should be exactly one word. If you are
    unsure how to spell some of the words, you may find it in the
    vocabulary task below.</p>
  <h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
  <p>
    You can use the following shortcuts for a quick navigation <span
      class="unavailable dart">both with the HTML5 audio player
      and</span> in the questionnaire.

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p class="q"> <span class="anchor" data-timestamp="0">play from here</span> 
      <i class="person">Darren Rogan:</i> Hello and welcome to Hack and Heckle. Today
      we have an interview with Gilad Bracha who works at Google on the
      Dart language. Joining me today is Gilad Bracha, is that correct?
    </p>
    <p class="a">
      <i class="person">Gilad Bracha:</i> Close enough. Usually Gilad Bracha is what
      English speakers should say because they gag otherwise.
    </p>

    <p class="q"><span class="anchor" data-timestamp="54">play</span>How do you pronounce it?</p>
    <p class="a">Gilad Bracha.</p>

    <p class="q">Okay, I’ve got no chance.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, I don’t— That’s okay.</p>

    <h4>Dart</h4>
    <p class="q">
      So you’re doing a talk here called <i>Explorations in Next
        Generation Web Languages</i>, and you were just saying before we
      started that it was more about languages themselves that are
      related to webs. Do you want to just give a quick synopsis of
      [crosstalk 00:36]?
    </p>
    <p class="a">Sure. So two languages. One is Dart, Dart is the
      language we’re working on at Google for web programming. It’s
      designed to make it easier to develop large-scale web apps,
      especially for people who might be uncomfortable with JavaScript,
      people from a more traditional software engineering background,
      Java, C#, whatever. But generally it’s more structured. The larger
      your apps get, the more you need kind of some sort of standard
      structure. We have classes. We have a form of type-checking, which
      is interesting, it's optional type-checking. We have a standard
      library, we have all kinds of things that you don’t get in
      JavaScript, which is proving to be very useful at Google, and it’s
      open-source and we’re putting *** out [crosstalk 01:24]</p>

    <p class="q">Is there a dependency-management framework in it,
      or—</p>
    <p class="a">There’s, I’m not sure what you mean here, there is
      a package manager that—</p>

    <p class="q">Yeah, package manager.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, yeah sure. Lots of the usual paraphernalia
      that you really want to have standardized. That's a bit of an
      issue in JavaScript. There’s a lot to choose from there, but you
      have to make the choices, then other people have made other
      choices and they don’t inter-operate, so it’s a big problem. There
      are lots of other issues, but just to give you an idea of what
      Dart is about. The other language, Newspeak, is a language that I
      developed a few years ago that is much more, I guess, radical.
      Dart is aimed at, for more mainstream adoption, we're at 1.0,
      it’s something Google’s putting out and using in its products.</p>

    <h4>Newspeak</h4>
    <p class="q">I have heard of it but I haven’t actually spent any
      time looking at it, although Newspeak, I haven’t actually heard of
      that one.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, I’m not terribly surprised, right, if you’re
      not reading the programming language research literature or are
      hardcore, you probably haven’t because it doesn’t have— Tt’s a
      small kind of labor-of-love kind of thing, it doesn’t have a lot
      of backing. I had some funding before the crash in 2008, and after
      that it’s been more a volunteer, open-source thing.</p>

    <p class="q">What would be the difference between it and Dart
      for example?</p>
    <p class="a">Newspeak is really trying to push the envelope in a
      lot of ways, so it has very powerful modularity properties,
      probably more powerful than any language you’ve seen. The sort of
      simplistic way of putting it is dependency-injection built into
      the language. I don’t particularly like that, but it’s something
      that maybe people can relate to without my giving a half-hour
      explanation. It also comes with its own— It has an IDE written in
      itself, it’s very flexible, with a lot of— I don’t know if you’ve
      heard of Smalltalk, but it’s in the tradition of Smalltalk and
      Self, but with a bit more, mainly modularity and security brought
      in mind.</p>

    <h4>Language design</h4>
    <p class="q">Okay. Is language construction something— I would
      imagine it’s a quite difficult field to get into, quite small. I
      remember when I was at Uni studying compilers I thought “this
      would be lots of fun but I’d never get a job.”</p>
    <p class="a">It is— Getting a job in this is not something you
      can really reliably plan for. Mostly it’s, most people who do this
      in academia, there are very few of us who manage to get paid
      full-time in industry to work on this. You really have to be very
      specialized, right? That’s certainly true. It’s not just
      compilers. Compilers is comparatively easy to get a job. There are
      loads of, relatively speaking, from my perspective, loads of
      people work on implementation, but actually language design and so
      forth, there are very, very few and we all know each other, right?
      There are some people at Microsoft, Google, used to be at Sun. I
      spent a lot of time working on Java as well and other things.
      Yeah, it’s a very specialized [fun work 04:27]</p>

    <p class="q">It seems it would be quite enjoyable as well. It’s
      one of those jobs like a referee. No one’s going to— Any time they
      had a problem, they always blame the referee at the end of the
      day. Thankless job, you know what I mean?</p>
    <p class="a">Well, I know exactly what you mean, but it’s nice
      work if you can get it. If you really— People care about
      programming languages in a quite irrational way, right, because
      it’s in your face all the time. It’s what you’re actually—</p>

    <p class="q">Would you be in [inaudible 00:04:54] Douglas
      Crockford. You’ve seen the discussion that Haskell guy wanted a
      knife fight over disregarding a type system?</p>
    <p class="a">Ooh, I missed that. I’ve been in those fights all
      the time and I’ve played both sides of the street actually on
      that. Sure, it’s almost like religion, right. It gets very
      passionate, very emotional, and it’s really very important to
      people, the language they work on. There’s a lot of discussion of
      the pro’s and con’s and technical reasons, but in the end there’s
      something more going on here.</p>

    <p class="q">Emotional decisions.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, yeah.</p>

    <h4>Future of Dart</h4>
    <p class="q">So would you say that Dart is going, hopefully, to
      be a successor to JavaScript? Is that what—</p>
    <p class="a">That’s not really what we’re after. That is the
      one-line characterization that a lot of people have put out.</p>

    <p class="q">Yeah, I’ve heard that myself. I haven’t really
      looked at it.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, it’s not necessarily very helpful. We’re
      trying to give people a meaningful alternative. We think that
      competition is good, choice is good. Having people confirm a fact
      that the only language you can use on a web browser realistically
      is JavaScript is, that’s not going to last. The world doesn’t work
      that way.</p>

    <p class="q">It’s also depressing as well, a little bit.</p>
    <p class="a">Yes, but, I don’t want to get into that particular
      war. Lots of people are going to compile to JavaScript. The
      difficulty is that, unless you have a lot of resources and
      expertise, you’re going to lose performance in that transition, or
      else your language is so close to JavaScript it really didn’t
      matter in the first place. It’s easy to make some sort of, easy—</p>

    <p class="q">Yeah, DSL basically on top of JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, but unless it changes something important,
      it’s not that interesting. If it changes something important,
      you’ll find that it is not easy to compile to and you need
      resources to fly all these kind of things to make compilers really
      work. Dart basically, the JavaScript that you get out of Dart runs
      about as fast as the JavaScript you run by hand. Oddly enough, we
      couldn’t believe it at first, but it turns out in some cases even
      faster, because the compiler sometimes does some optimizations
      that a reasonable person wouldn’t do. We’re in that ballpark, so
      you’re not really losing any performance by going to Dart.
      Basically there isn’t, in our view, there isn’t a downside, but
      that has taken a lot of clever Google engineers a fair amount of
      work, and many language projects will not have those resources to
      do that.</p>

    <p class="q">Would you say there’s much of an uptake towards
      Dart?</p>
    <p class="a">There’s an uptake. First of all, Google had
      multiple goals with this one. The most important one is to make
      Google more efficient, right? So we invest no small amount in web
      programming. We’ve written probably more JavaScript code than
      anybody else. A lot of people came to the conclusion that it would
      be productive to have something different. Beyond that, outside we
      just launched 1.0 in mid-November, so we’re in it for the long
      haul. There’s people using it, there’s people, even before we had
      1.0, there’s people doing startups with it, which is rather brave
      of them given that we were changing things under their feet all
      the time. Definitely we expect to see considerable update. The
      language has been designed to be kind of comfortable for people.
      It’s very familiar, if you come from the curly-brace tradition,
      then you should be able to get the basic idea without any
      surprises.</p>

    <p class="q">Will there be any other support within Chrome, or
      is it always going to be built into a JavaScript?</p>
    <p class="a">Okay, so there’s actually a virtual machine as
      well. The virtual machine, I don’t know what our official stance
      is, but it’s going to find its way into Chrome at some point. The
      bar for getting to Chrome is incredibly high, for all kinds of
      both engineering reasons and security and [inaudible 00:08:50]
      footprint and all kinds of things, right? But we expect it, we’re
      quite sure it’ll get into Chrome at one point, right? At that
      point you’ll have the Dart being natively supported inside Chrome,
      which is no small thing because a very large proportion of the
      world’s desktops and an even larger proportion, probably, in terms
      of the world’s mobile. I don’t know when it’ll become ubiquitous,
      but it has an advantage. Right now, first of all you can run it on
      the server with better performance. The other advantage, which
      might be slightly surprising, is, a big problem with the tools
      that compile into JavaScript is the development cycle. They
      introduce a delay of these compilations, which can be quite slow
      at times and so forth. Our development environment basically uses
      a build of Chrome, of Chromium basically, that already has Dart in
      it, we call it Dartium. You get instantaneous response, just like
      with a dynamic language, like any other dynamic language like Ruby
      or JavaScript or something, so your development cycle is really
      quick.</p>

    <p class="q">I’m Java background, did a lot of Ruby lately. It’s hard to
      go back to that long build cycle.</p>
    <p class="a">Basically, a lot of us are old Smalltalkers at
      heart, and we had the short build cycle decades ago and the rest
      of the world looked strangely on us. Slowly these ideas are
      getting into the mainstream.</p>

    <h4>The name</h4>
    <p class="q">Were you involved in the name, because I think
      Dart’s a fantastic name?</p>
    <p class="a">Well, I wasn’t really involved in the name. There
      was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of names thrown about.</p>

    <p class="q">Really? What sort of alternative names were thrown
      about?</p>
    <p class="a">Let’s see, there was Dash. I think it was
      originally, the code name was Dash. I think that’s public
      knowledge. Dash had some, once you actually want a name you have
      to go through legal and whatnot.</p>

    <p class="q">And trademark infringements and—</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah, all kinds of things. So finding something
      that worked for everyone, that had that same flavor of being
      something light and fast and whatever took awhile. I can’t say
      that I was much involved in the name but I was there as the
      discussions went back and forth.</p>

    <p class="q">Okay, cool. I always like a good name. I like
      the*** stories where they come from. I just think it’s a bit
      strange with the train system being called Dart in the Bay Area as
      well, which …</p>
    <p class="a">It’s called Bart actually.</p>


    <p class="q">Bart, sorry.</p>
    <p class="a">So that’s a different matter. That’s Bay Area Rapid
      Transit.</p>

    <p class="q">Bay Area, yeah. I kept thinking it was Dart.</p>
    <p class="a">Yeah. That might be Dublin, in Ireland.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="q">Yes, it could be. I think it’s the Dart in Dublin.
      I get them confused [inaudible 00:11:27] Is there any other talks
      that you’re interested in attending or that you’ve already seen?</p>
    <p class="a">I’ve, there’s a couple of talks on language NVMs so
      … The Facebook guys have this interesting take on this language
      hack which is basically PHP slightly cleaned up and with a type
      system. I don’t want to say anything good about PHP, but they’ve
      done very good work in terms of … there’s some commonality along.
      This is a trend that we’re starting to see really take off of type
      systems for what were otherwise dynamic-type programming
      languages. They’re doing that in PHP. We have such a system for
      Dart. This has been a hobbyhorse of mine for 20 years. We built
      one for Smalltalk many years ago and so forth, so again, it takes
      that long. When you do something in research or whatever, it takes
      20, 30, whatever years until you see it in the mainstream, so you
      don’t get too many opportunities. The Microsoft guys have
      TypeScript, which is basically a—</p>

    <p class="q">A typing system for JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="a">A typing system for JavaScript, and there’s all
      kinds of technical differences between these things, but they’re
      actually all kind of in the same flavor in a lot of ways and
      that's kind of cool.</p>

    <p class="q">Might bring it to an end. Thank you very much.</p>
    <p class="a">You’re very welcome.</p>

    <p class="q">And I hope you enjoy your time here in Australia.</p>
    <p class="a">Thank you.</p>
