  <p>On October 30, 1935, at Wright Air Field in Dayton, Ohio, the U.S.
    Army Air Corps held a flight competition for airplane manufacturers
    vying to build its next-generation long-range bomber. It wasn’t
    supposed to be much of a competition. In early evaluations, the
    Boeing Corporation’s gleaming aluminum-alloy Model 299 had trounced
    the designs of Martin and Douglas. Boeing’s plane could carry five
    times as many bombs as the Army had requested; it could fly faster
    than previous bombers, and almost twice as far. A Seattle
    newspaperman who had glimpsed the plane called it the “flying
    fortress,” and the name stuck. The flight “competition,” according
    to the military historian Phillip Meilinger, was regarded as a mere
    formality. The Army planned to order at least sixty-five of the
    aircraft.</p>

  <p>A small crowd of Army brass and manufacturing executives
    watched as the Model 299 test plane taxied onto the runway. It was
    sleek and impressive, with a hundred-and-three-foot wingspan and
    four engines jutting out from the wings, rather than the usual two.
    The plane roared down the tarmac, lifted off smoothly, and climbed
    sharply to three hundred feet. Then it stalled, turned on one wing,
    and crashed in a fiery explosion. Two of the five crew members died,
    including the pilot, Major Ployer P. Hill.</p>

  <p>An investigation revealed that nothing mechanical had gone
    wrong. The crash had been due to “pilot error,” the report said.
    Substantially more complex than previous aircraft, the new plane
    required the pilot to attend to the four engines, a retractable
    landing gear, new wing flaps, electric trim tabs that needed
    adjustment to maintain control at different airspeeds, and
    constant-speed propellers whose pitch had to be regulated with
    hydraulic controls, among other features. While doing all this, Hill
    had forgotten to release a new locking mechanism on the elevator and
    rudder controls. The Boeing model was deemed, as a newspaper put it,
    “too much airplane for one man to fly.” The Army Air Corps declared
    Douglas’s smaller design the winner. Boeing nearly went bankrupt.</p>

  <p>Still, the Army purchased a few aircraft from Boeing as test
    planes, and some insiders remained convinced that the aircraft was
    flyable. So a group of test pilots got together and considered what
    to do.</p>

  <p>They could have required Model 299 pilots to undergo more
    training. But it was hard to imagine having more experience and
    expertise than Major Hill, who had been the U.S. Army Air Corps’
    chief of flight testing. Instead, they came up with an ingeniously
    simple approach: they created a pilot’s checklist, with step-by-step
    checks for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing. Its mere existence
    indicated how far aeronautics had advanced. In the early years of
    flight, getting an aircraft into the air might have been
    nerve-racking, but it was hardly complex. Using a checklist for
    takeoff would no more have occurred to a pilot than to a driver
    backing a car out of the garage. But this new plane was too
    complicated to be left to the memory of any pilot, however expert.</p>

  <p>With the checklist in hand, the pilots went on to fly the Model
    299 a total of 1.8 million miles without one accident. The Army
    ultimately ordered almost thirteen thousand of the aircraft, which
    it dubbed the B-17. And, because flying the behemoth was now
    possible, the Army gained a decisive air advantage in the Second
    World War which enabled its devastating bombing campaign across Nazi
    Germany.</p>
